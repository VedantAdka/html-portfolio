<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Vedant Adka, a passionate and driven software developer with a strong foundation in Flutter, Python, and Web Development. With hands-on experience in building engaging mobile apps and intelligent automation systems, I thrive at the intersection of creativity and technology.</p>

<p>I've worked on impactful projects like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Flash Chat app with real-time messaging using Firebase.</li>
  <li>A Destiny Game app blending storytelling and logic using Flutter.</li>
  <li>Automation projects in UiPath, including customer support systems and invoice data extraction.</li>
  <li>Research on Tomato Leaf Disease Detection using deep learning, combining classification, infection analysis, and fertilizer recommendation.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm also experienced in integrating JWT authentication, building REST APIs with Flask, and deploying robust frontend applications with React and Next.js.</p>
<p>When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me playing Valorant, diving into tech communities, or exploring innovative ideas in AI and product development.</p>
